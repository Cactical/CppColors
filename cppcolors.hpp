Version 1
Cpp Colors -- by Cactical
A file with asci escape colors codes mapped to variables that can be used to color text.

Made with love :)

This file contains variables with colors that you can use to color your strings when printing them.
ex. std::cout << blue << "example";
The text and every other text you print will stay on that color, unless you put it on a different color.
